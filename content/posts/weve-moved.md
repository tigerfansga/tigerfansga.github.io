It's been just over two weeks since I started this blog. My original plan was to use [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org) to manage my site.
I had worked with Wordpress previously, and it is very popular.
I decided to use [hostinger](https://www.hostinger.com/) to host the blog.

I found hostinger pretty easy to setup, but ran across [Hugo.](https://gohugo.io/) Hugo is a tool that converts [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) into static html.
There are lots of themes, and add ons for things like comments and Google analytics.

I will be hosting the site on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and will comments in the coming days. I've copied over the posts from Wordpress. I will be learning Hugo as I go so look for new features and posts about Hugo in the future.
