I’ve been an IT professional for 28 years, sports fanatic for 50 years 😱, a father for 27 years and a husband for 33 years. And now I’m a blogger for one day.

It’s been quite an interesting day. I tried to setup this WordPress site using a free hosting site but struggled to get my domain to work with it. After setting it up two times only to have the site return to the “Welcome to famous five-minute WordPress install” page, I decided to go all in. I found a paid hosting provider I [liked](https://www.hostinger.com/) and paid for a year.

So, for at least a year, I will blogging whatever tickles my fancy, be it technology, wine, sports, whiskey, or whatever life throws my way.
