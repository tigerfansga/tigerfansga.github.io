After nearly two months of studying and taking practice tests, I took and passed my [AZ-104](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/certifications/exams/az-104) exam to receive my [Azure Adminstrator Associate](https://www.credly.com/badges/ca363cc7-51c1-42aa-9763-868793f2e2f8/public_url) certification.

My primary tool for preparing for the AZ-104 exam was [Microsoft Learn.](https://learn.microsoft.com/) I highly recommend taking practice tests for this exam. Many of the questions are detailed limits for Azure resources. I cannot emphasize enough that hands on experience with the base Azure solutions of storage, key vault, compute, recovery vault, monitor, subscriptions, and Azure policy is required for this exam.

Also, knowledge of the [Azure Cli](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/) interface and the [Az Powershell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/?view=azps-8.3.0) module is essential. Both interfaces are large so comprehensive knowledge of them is not needed, but a working knowlege of their structure and some basic commands for working with storage, compute, recover vault, and monitor is needed.

Passing this exam was an essential step towards obtaining my [Azure Solutions Architect Expert](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/certifications/azure-solutions-architect/) certification. I post my progress toward this goal here over the coming days.
